Hi How are you

1  * I have an application, how you will setup a VPC ? what all the components you use ?
		Components of VPC::
			○ Subnet
			○ Routing table
			○ Internet Gateway (IGW)
			○ Instances
			○ Security Group
			○ Network ACL 
			○ VPC endpoints
			○ NAT Gateway
			○ Elastic IP 
		
		Setting up VPC  - yes, explain the detailed process of creating subent, IGW, assigning subnet to routing table via subnet association, NAT gateway creation etc… etc..
		
	2  * Where you will set the Route Table ?
		Under VPC we will set route table 
		We will set route table for both private subnet and public route table (or) based on the subnet requirement
		
	3  * Services used in AWS ?
			○ IAM
			○ EC2
			○ S3
			○ VPC
			○ CloudWatch
			○ CloudTrail
			○ Route53
			○ Lambda
			○ SNS 
			○ SQS 
			○ Dynamo DB
			○ CloudFront
			○ CloudFormation 
		
	4  * How can you make any S3 bucket as private ?
			Bydefault S3 bucket is private 
			To make it public  { S3 bucket --> Permission --> Uncheck "Block all public access" } 

	5  * Cross region replication ? how you apply it ? will it copy automatically ?  -- Do it yourself , try to configure yourself to understand it better 

			○  Cross-Region replication --> Having 2 S3 buckets on 2 different region and data written in source S3 bucket is replicated on destination S3 bucket
			○  Will it copy automatically ? --> Yes, once replication is enabled, data is copied automatically on destination S3 but for only data which is written after the replication is configured, data present in source S3 bucket prior to replication will not be made available/copied automatically on destination S3 bucket 

	7  * Read replica
			AWS RDS Read Replica is creating one (or) more read only copies of your database in your existing AWS region (or) in a different AWS region 

	10 * How to you manage credentials ?
			AWS Secrets Manager

	12 * You are working on EC2 and that goes down and how do you resolve this ?
			Check your ec2 instance on AWS console
			Select the instance and under instance state --> decide on the operation to stop (or) reboot the instance (or) terminate 
		

	13 * You want to give a access to a EC2 and you have only pvt
			Assign the appropriate EC2 policy and  attach to the user
	
	
	14 * EKS ?
		Elastic Kubernetes Service --> need to go through	

	15 * VPC ? suppose I have a server, need to download the packages from the internet, but sever should not be accessed directly from outside ? how you can do that
			NAT Gateway  { check Bastion Host also } 

	16 * 2 AWS accounts, my EC2 of 1 account should talk to my another EC2 ? How ?
			VPC peering  

	17 * IAM ? I have 10 instances, how do you give access to user for only 5 resources ?
			a. Create custom policy, using AWS policy generator  --> https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/
			b. Add the arn for your instances for which you need to give access to {arn:aws:ec2:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:instance/<instance-id>}
				i. Example arn:: arn:aws:ec2:ap-south-1:892145454499:instance/i-01e8028f2af843ddb 
			c. Copy the JSON from the policy generator and then copy to the create policy, new policy json 
			d. Attach the policy then to the user 

		Now login via the user and check the actions that can be performed for the accessible instances 

	18 * Cross region Route53 ?
			○ Answer is Route53 Resolver, inbound endpoints, outbound endpoint 
			○ Explanation is here --> https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/using-route-53-private-hosted-zones-for-cross-account-multi-region-architectures/
		
	19 * Health checks in Route53
			○ Monitor the health and performance of the endpoints
			○ Create health check to monitor inbound/outbound endpoints 
			○ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlaWYedWnb0
		
	20 * DualStack configuration in Route53  -- Need to check the configuration yourself and get comfortable
			Both IPv4 and IPv6  records are returned for an EC2 classic instance but dualstack DNS 
			Configuration needs to be checked

	21 * what is S3 and why customer choose S3 ?
			S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an Object Oriented Storage, we can store any file, any amount of data, anytime from anywhere on the web as an "Object"
			Why S3:
				Easily accessible from anywhere (URL can be accessed by end user)
				Any amount of data can be written to it 
				Low latency, high performance  

	22 * When the jar is created, how will you push it to S3?
			○ Make sure that AWS cli is installed 
			○ Run command 
				"aws  s3  cp  filename  s3://s3bucketname "    
		
	23 * dynamoDB
			Serverless NoSQL database fully managed by AWS 

	24 * vpc architecture
			Needs detailed explanation of the components and it's working , Refer notes and prepare on your own 
				Components of VPC::
					○ Subnet
					○ Routing table
					○ Internet Gateway (IGW)
					○ Instances
					○ Security Group
					○ Network ACL 
					○ VPC endpoints
					○ NAT Gateway
					○ Elastic IP 
			
	25 * why we need ELB & how you select which type of loadbalancer suitable for my application.
			• ELB - Elastic Load Balancers , 
			• we need load balancers to balancer the requests coming to the application servers (or) balance the load of the requests asked to service by the application servers
									– (or) - 
			• It automatically distributes incoming application traffic and scales resources to meet traffic demands 
		
			• Explain the below and answer will contain the scenario where it would be used 
				○ Application Load Balancer  
				○ Network Load Balancer
				  Gateway Load Balancer

	27 * cloudwatch & cloudtrail
			Cloudwatch --> It collects logs, events and metrics for all AWS resources 
			Cloudtrail --> It helps in auditing, security monitoring of user activity and API useage 
	
	31 * customer has 50 (or) 100 odd aws accounts they are looking for a solution so that each and every single vpc can communicate with each other how you are going to establish that connectivity?
	
		Using VPC peering along with cross-account role
		Using AWS CloudFormation and creating templates having restrictive policies
		https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/peer-with-vpc-in-another-account.html
	 
    32 * customer has a physical side production environment (or) workloads are running on aws there is 1 particular Ip/CIDR which is continuously hitting their environment multiple times in a day they are suspecting that a malicious activity they are asking you to block any kind of a traffic from a Ip/CIDR how you will going to block them?
	
		By adding the ip/CIDR in NACL inbound traffic rule to DENY 

	33 * CIDR for 15 ec2 instances , 2 subnets 1 private and 1 public , write CIDR ranges 
	
		10.5.1.0/27 - 15 ec2 instance 
		10.5.2.0/27  - 1 private
		10.5.3.0/27 -  1 public 
	
	35 * how you can access a machine without a .pem key?
	
		==>  Go to AWS console use EC2 connect to access the ec2 instance 
		==> 
		Accessing the EC2 instance even if you loose the pem file is rather easy.
		1. First, create a new instance by creating new access file, call it 'helper' instance with same region and VPC as of the lost pem file instance.
		2. Now stop the lost pem file instance. Remember not to terminate instance but to stop it.
		3. Goto EBS volumes, select the root volume of the lost pem file instance and detach.
		4. Now again select the detached volume and this time you have to attach this volume to helper instance which we created before. Since helper instance already has a root volume by default as /dev/sda1, the newly attached volume will be secondary(eg: /dev/sdf).
		5. Login to your helper instance with its pem file.
		6. Execute below commands:
			# mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
			# cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/root/.ssh/
			# umount /mnt
		7. Detach the secondary volume from helper instance. 
		8. Again attach the volume back to our recovery instance. Start the instance. Terminate the helper instance.
		Use helper instance pem file to log into recovery instance.

	37 * how your sharing the key  for a group of 4 members & these 4 members will be logged in from same username after 4/5 days customer complaining that a file deleted how can you track back who did what?
		CloudTrail - auditing tool 
	
	38 * what instances you are using in your project? why particular those instances?
		C5. large, x-large
		C6.large
		C4
		M4, m5 
		Based on the application requirement, performance, compute optimization
	
    39 * customer is asking you to change the instances family to 2 ec2 instances which are part of the autoscalling groups siting on a load balancer
	 & the condition is they are not looking for new instances and none of the instances to be deleted
	 how your going to change the instance family of these 2 instances?
	
			Update in Launch configuration /Launch template.
			Afterwards you can terminate the running instances one by one, the auto scaling group will relaunch them with updated properties.
	
	41 * pre signed url in s3?
		To give temporary access of a private S3 bucket to a user 
		https://youtu.be/h1jP1D-GeBM
	
	
   42 * different routing policies in aws? which policy you have used for your project?
		• Simple routing policy — Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website.
		• Weighted routing policy — Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.
		• Latency routing policy — Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.
		• Failover routing policy — Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.
		• Geolocation routing policy — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users.
		• Geoproximity routing policy — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.
		  Multivalue answer routing policy — Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.
	
	43 * diff b/w cname and alias?
			○ CNAME record points a DNS name to another DNS name 
			○ Alias is similar to CNAME record but when querying it will behave like A record and give the target ip address 

	44 * what record used for dns to ip?
			A record 
	
	46 * what is API gateway why we need it ?
	
		 Choose your own definition and go for it 
	
	47 * How you bind role to account ( script explain)
		 Create custom policy and assign to a role
 
	48 * how you configure autoscaling and cloud load balancer, Where your application is running EC2 or EKS , Why your team went manual instead of using EKS
	
		{Possible Answer-- Need to check}

		EKS is expensive and going manual via Kubeadm method on ec2 instance is cheaper for project/application requirement 

	51 * Security group  ,nacl 
			○ Security group is configure inbound traffic (outbound traffic is default configured, unless specifically restriced)   {Stateful}
			NACL - Network access control list is to control the inbound and outbound traffic on the network (or) VPC where is it configured  (Stateless)

	56 * difference between nat instance and nat gateway
			NAT Gateway -- to allow private subnet to access the pubic network (internet) via outbound traffic, inbound traffic from internet is restricted via NAT gateway
			
	58 * aws VPC components
			Subnet, routing table, IGW, NAT Gateway, NACL, Security Group 

	59 * what are the DB you are going to use
			○ Depending on the requirment, structured (or) non-structured DB requirement
			○ If Structured - SQl, MySQL, Aurora, MariaDB
			○ Non-Structured - Dynamo DB, MongoDB
	
	61 * difference between network lb and application lb
			Network LB -- works on connection level (network traffic) 
			Application LB -- works on request level (application request)
						HTTP (or) HTTPS 
	62 * about Route 53
			Explain Route53 -- DNS server 
			Maps hostname to ip address and vice versa 
	
	63 * about autoscaling
			Automatically adjusts the capacity of the application 
			Horizontal scaling  -- adding the number of instances to support the application 
			Vertical scaling  -- increasing the capacity of the instance (compute, ram etc..)

	65 * how will you restrict inbound traffic when outbound traffic in open
			Using Security Groups 

	66 * what is vpc and vpc peering
			VPC - virtual private cloud, VPC peering is method to connect between 2 VPC's 

	67 * How will an instance present in Oregon can access a S3 bucket present in Sydney without any manual intervention?
		 (only the ec2 shd b able to access the S3 without any user involved in it,)
		
			Making the S3 bucket as Public  (also check if Assume role can be used or not ) 
		
	69 * One ALB with 2 instances A and B and ALB is mapped with 2 website site1 and site2, Can we configure requests which comes to site1 mapped to instance A n site2 to instance B,  Can we achieve this behaviour using ALB?
			ALB configuring Listeners and routing, where port/protocol configured with either A (or) B instance and given the target group 

	72 * I have one S3 bucket in which im going to upload 3 files, one with 2TB, 4.9TB and 5.1TB,  So how many files will get uploaded into S3 bucket?

			2 files will be uploaded, 2 TB and 4.9 TB, 5.1TB file will be rejected as 5TB is the maximum size limit of a object
	
	74 * I have 10 ec2 with ALB, each of the instance have 100GB EBS vol. One instance memory utilisation has crossed 80%
	     and manager asked u to increase the vol to 1TB with zero downtime for all instances, how will u do that?
				Select the volume for the ec2 instance --> Actions --> Modify volume --> change to 1024 GB 
	
	77 * I have 2 subnets in VPC, how can I know which subnet is public?
				Go to Route table --> check for IGW connection --> then validate which subnet is associated to Routetable with IGW 

	78 * There is a public IP and u have to restrict all type of access for this publicIp, how will u do that?
				In VPC, choose NACL --> edit inbound and outbound rules ,
	
	80 * Which AWS service will be best suited for persistent vol for a specific pod in a cluster which will b catering 10000 requests.
					EKS 
	81 * Data shd b accessible at all point of time? S3 or EBS or EFS drive
					S3 
	
	86 * why we have to use SSL certificate
			To have secure authentication
	
	98 * how do you configure ec2 for high availability 
	  
			○ Elastic Load Balancing—you can launch several EC2 instances and distribute traffic between them
			○ Availability Zones—you can place instances in different Azs
			○ Auto Scaling—use auto-scaling to detect when loads increase, and then dynamically add more instances
			○ create two EC2 instances and use Route 53 DNS failover to resolve to an healthy instance
	
	99 * what are options aws provide for highly available ec2 if get trouble in one environment 
			○ Elastic Load Balancing—you can launch several EC2 instances and distribute traffic between them
			○ Availability Zones—you can place instances in different Azs
			○ Auto Scaling—use auto-scaling to detect when loads increase, and then dynamically add more instances
			○ create two EC2 instances and use Route 53 DNS failover to resolve to an healthy instance
	
	100* what are different configuration used for do autoscalling
	  
		Step 1: Create a launch template
		In the Amazon EC2 Dashboard, choose "Launch Templates" to create a launch template, specifying a name, AMI, instance type, and other details. Below are some guidelines on setting up your first launch template.
			•	Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI): We recommend the Amazon Linux 2 AMI (free-tier eligible). 
			•	Choose an instance type: We recommend the t2.micro (free-tier eligible).
			•	Security group: You have the option to configure your virtual firewall.
		
		Step 2 : Create an Auto Scaling group
			Using the Auto Scaling wizard, create an Auto Scaling group specifying a name, size, and network for your Auto Scaling group.
		
		Step 3: Add Elastic Load Balancers (Optional)
			When you set up Auto Scaling with Elastic Load Balancing, you can automatically distribute incoming application traffic across Amazon EC2 instances within your Auto Scaling groups to build highly available, fault-tolerant applications.
			Associate your load balancer with your Auto Scaling group to distribute traffic for your application across a fleet of EC2 instances that can scale with demand.
			You must first create a load balancer.
		
		Step 4: Configure Scaling Policies (Optional)
			Configure scaling policies for your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group.

	102* how can we connect s3 through vpc privately
						Create a new access point on S3 and specify the VPC id through which we need to connect 

	103* how can we execute round robin waited routing of route53

			Traffic policy --> Create traffic policy --> Weighted rule (either 1 or 3 ) --> specify endpoint

	105* Apln load balancer :
						Create application load balancer 
						Choose an Application Load Balancer when you need a flexible feature set for your applications with HTTP and HTTPS traffic
					
	106* User data ,meta data
						User data is information that we can provide to an instance, which is accessed during the starting of an instance, so if any script needs to be run when instance starts up, we can provide the information in instance user data
						Meta data --> data about instance, which will help in configuring the instance 
	107* Listener target 
						 Listener target is the target group that the load balancer needs to send the traffic to 
						 We specify the type of protocol, port number and the target value (complete path) 
	108* Cross zone load balancing 
						 Elastic Load balancing -->https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html 
						 Create a Network load balancer (or) Gateway load balancer and then enable the cross zone load balancing option after the creation of the load balancers 
	109* Application load balancer , classic network; disable ,pricing

					Types of load balancer need to explain, pricing - check aws pricing
					
	120* SQL vs No SQL
				Structured DB vs Unstructured DB 

	121* In aws, i have an instance which is critical machine that cant go down and its reaching 100% cpu utilisation.
						what are the steps that u r going to take to save this machine from going down? 
				Autoscaling --> add the running instance to an existing AutoScaling group (or) create an autoscaling group based on the running instance 
				Horizontal (or) Vertical autoscaling can be chosen 

	123* I have a ec2 instance, I want to change the private ip of that instance, can I do that?
				No, private ip address is permanent for the instance lifetime and it cannot be changed 

	124* Can I change the private ip of running ec2 instance?
				No, private ip address is permanent for the instance lifetime and it cannot be changed 

	125* I have a S3 bucket, which my client want to track the access for internal audit.
				CloudTrail is the auditing tool
