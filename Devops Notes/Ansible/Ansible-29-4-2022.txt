Asible facts
	- Asible facts are the variable which contains the details of target hosts
	- all the facts are prefixed with ansible_ word
    - setup module is used to gather all facts (ansible all -m setup)	
	
Install package on both ubuntu and redhat by refering the facts

Ansible run a task only if previous is success 
	- using register we can able to achive this condition 
	- register will save the output in a variable in JSON format only if the task executes
	  successfuly 
	- we can register the output of task which we want check the status and on another task 
      we can check register variable got values or not

Ansible debug 
	- print output of a task with register varibale

Ansible Run specific tasks / plays 
	 - Using tags we can run specific task or play in a playbook
  Example:	 
---

 - name: Play_1
   hosts: all
   tasks:
     - name: Install git on Ubuntu
       become: yes
       apt:
         name: git
         state: present
         update_cache: yes
       tags:
         - ubuntu_pkg
     - name: Install curl
       become: yes
       apt:
         name: curl
         state: present
         update_cache: yes
       tags:
         - curl_pkg

ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --tags="ubuntu_pkg"
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --skip-tags="ubuntu_p

      
	 To run only task with the tag
		ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --tags="tag_name1,tag_name2"
		ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --tags="ubuntu_pkg"
	
         To skip a tagged play / task 
		ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --skip-tags="tag_name1,tag_name2"
		ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --skip-tags="ubuntu_pkg"
		
		
Ansible Roles
	- Roles are better way of organizing my playbooks
	- Instead of defining everything play, handlers, templates etc. in a single file 
	  we can define it in a proper folder structure using roles 
	- default location od roles is /etc/ansible/role (if directory is not present create it)  
	- ansible-galaxy is the tool which ansible gives us to create a role 
            ansible-galaxy init <role_name>
        - Download the roles from ansible galaxy 
           ansible-galaxy install <role_name>	
	- Role directory structure
		roles
			└── install_pkg
				├── README.md
				├── defaults
				│   └── main.yml
				├── files
				├── handlers
				│   └── main.yml

					└── main.yml

	tasks - Conatins the main list of task that we want to execute by the role.
			main.yml is where we put our tasks 
	handlers - Contains tasks which are executed only if it is notified by other task after 
			   successful execution (if there is change from the notifing task).
        defaults - It contains default variables for the role and it is the least precedence 
				varible in ansible.
	vars  - The variables which will be used by role. These variable can be defined in our       
			playbook also. (task/play variables)
	files - Contains static file that can be coppied to hosts by role 
			In task I don't need use the complete path just filename is used to copy.
	templates - used to define dynamic value in files and copy it to host with values defined.
				this uses jinja2 format templating.
	meta - To define role dependencies.			
     			
Ansible Vault

 ansible-vault create vault.yml

 ansible-vault  encrypt inventory.txt

 ansible-vault view vault.yml
 
 ansible-vault edit vault.yml

 ansible-vault decrypt vault.yml


Ansible variables
---
- hosts: all
  vars:
    hello: world
  tasks:
  - name: Ansible Basic Variable Example
    debug:
      msg: "{{ hello }}"

ansible-playbook <file> --extra-var hello=123

Assignment:
1. write a single playbook which install java, git, wget on ubuntu machine and curl, python, tomcat on redhat machine.
2. Write a playbook which accepts command line arguments and print it to the console
3. create a vault and store the password. Demonstrate all relevant commands.
